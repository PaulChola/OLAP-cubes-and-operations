## Overview

This repository contains a Python script that performs the following tasks:

- Creates a connection to DuckDB and imports diabetes data from a CSV file.
- Constructs an OLAP cube to aggregate data by selected dimensions.
- Demonstrates OLAP cube operations, including dicing and rolling up.
- Applies K-Means clustering to identify patterns in the data.
- Visualizes clustering results with a 3D scatter plot.
